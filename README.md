## Installation

1. Launch _Quick Open_:

    - Linux & Windows: `Ctrl+P`
    - macOS: `âŒ˜+P`

2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:

```shell
ext install open-payments-snippets-vscode
```

3. Choose the extension (make sure the author is `Interledger Foundation`).

4. Reload Visual Studio Code

## Usage

Every Open Payments SDK snippet starts with the "op-" prefix:

-   `op-pp`
-   `op-grant-continue`

You don't need to type any dashes or the full keyword. You can use some alternatives. For example:

-   `ogc` -> `op-grant-continue` snippet
-   `ograntc` -> `op-grant-continue` snippet
